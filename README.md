Tangible_Carom_Tutor
====================

Team members : Soham Sankaran, Chintak Sheth, Gaurang Sadekar, Ramanathan and Kshitiz Sethia.

The prototype was developed during the MIT Media Lab Design Innovation Lab  2013 at PESIT, Bangalore. 
				       
------------------------------------------

This is a tangible carom tutor which basically projects the direction in which the user should hit a carom coin to score, depending on the position of the striker. We used Kinect (for coin and finger recognition) and a projector. We used Processing for the project.

The code is contained in carom_tutor.pde file and has been successfully tested with a single coin system. 

We are in the developmental stage of extending it for being able to play a complete game. 

Feel free to use or extend or develop it in any way.

-------------------------------------------

The code is developed in Processing.
